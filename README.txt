Key features of the interface (e.g., buttons for interaction, data visualization).

Optimization Techniques:

Summary of the optimization techniques applied to the smart contracts (e.g., gas optimization, security improvements, etc.).

Screenshots
Include relevant screenshots of the GUI or the project in action.

Provide captions for each image to explain what’s being shown.

Setup Instructions
